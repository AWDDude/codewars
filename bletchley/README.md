Dearest Mr. AWDDude:

The oddest thing occurred today, and I thought you'd much want to know about it. While cleaning a long-closed area of Bletchley Park last week for a new exhibit, the cleaning crew found a roll of computer punch tape in an old filing cabinet. The dating on it is not clear: we've had our scientist exam the tape, and we cannot be certain as to whether it was produced during the War, or sometime after during the time the Post Office or the GPO or Civil Aviation Authority was in custody of the property. But certainly it would have been before the early nineties. We were able to make operable an old tape reader to read in the contents, though the reader failed often and we had to do our best to verify the transfer by hand. I do hope the contents are sufficiently correct.

Our scientists do not know what exactly to make of the content. It would appear to be some sort of RLE (run length encoded) values, though to what ends, we can't be certain. There are modern file formats which use this method to compress images, but we believe this was likely produced before the modern bitmapped image was common. So make of that what you will. I have attached a text file with the contents.

I am told that you have a team of expert coders at your company that might be able to assist in unraveling this mystery. Sadly all our code breakers are long gone. Perhaps you can enlist them to help us? It would be a great kindness if they would be willing to help.

Hand-written on the back of the tape were the letters "PC - POW". We can't help but imagine that the POW might refer to "Prisoner of War"... which only heightens our curiosity.
Thank you for anything you can do in this matter.

P.S. The cleaners also found this fragment of burnt paper in a waste paper bin nearby. I don't know if it's related or not, but I thought I'd include a picture anyway.
